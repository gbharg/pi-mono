  Combines /careful (warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc.) with
  /freeze (blocks edits outside a specified directory). Use for maximum safety
  when touching prod or debugging live systems. Use when asked to "guard mode",
  "full safety", "lock it down", or "maximum safety".

# /guard — Full Safety Mode

Activates both destructive command warnings and directory-scoped edit restrictions.
This is the combination of `/careful` + `/freeze` in a single command.

**Dependency note:** This skill references hook scripts from the sibling `/careful`
and `/freeze` skill directories. Both must be installed (they are installed together
by the gstack setup script).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"guard","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Setup

If the user already specified a directory in their request, use that directory directly — do not ask again. Otherwise, ask which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Guard mode: which directory should edits be restricted to? Destructive command warnings are always on. Files outside the chosen path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

**Edge case — user wants no edit restriction:** If the user says they want to edit files "anywhere" or "everywhere," explain that guard mode includes both destructive command warnings AND an edit boundary. Recommend setting a broad freeze boundary (the recommended default):

1. **Recommended:** Set the freeze boundary to the repo root or home directory — this keeps both guard protections active with a broad scope. Detect the repo root automatically:
```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "$HOME")
echo "Suggested broad boundary: $REPO_ROOT"
```
2. **Alternative:** If the user explicitly says they don't want any edit boundary at all, suggest `/careful` instead (destructive command warnings only, no edit restriction).

Ask the user which they prefer. Default to option 1 (broad boundary) if the user agrees or doesn't express a strong preference.

- If the user chooses the broad boundary (option 1): use the detected repo root or home directory path and proceed with the freeze setup steps below.
- If the user explicitly chooses `/careful` only (option 2): Do NOT write `freeze-dir.txt`. Tell the user: "**Careful mode active** (destructive command warnings only). No edit boundary is set. To add an edit boundary later, run `/freeze`." Include deactivation instructions: "To deactivate, end the session or start a new conversation." Then stop — setup is complete.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.gstack}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user:
- "**Guard mode active.** Two protections are now running:"
- "1. **Destructive command warnings** — rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc. will warn before executing (you can override)"
- "2. **Edit boundary** — file edits restricted to `<path>/`. Edits outside this directory are blocked."
- "To remove the edit boundary, run `/unfreeze`. To deactivate everything, end the session."

## What's protected

See `/careful` for the full list of destructive command patterns and safe exceptions.
See `/freeze` for how edit boundary enforcement works.
